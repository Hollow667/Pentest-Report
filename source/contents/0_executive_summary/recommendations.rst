Recommendations
===============
The pentester recommends patching the vulnerabilities identified during the penetration test to ensure that an attacker cannot exploit these systems in the future. One thing to remember is that these systems require frequent patching, and once patched, should remain on a regular patch program in order to mitigate additional vulnerabilities that may be discovered at a later date.

The pentester also advises stricter password guidelines and requirements, as suggested by NIST in publication 800-171r1 [#]_, section 3.5.
