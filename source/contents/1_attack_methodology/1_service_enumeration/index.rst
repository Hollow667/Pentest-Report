Service Enumeration
===================
The service enumeration portion of a penetration test focuses on gathering information about what services are alive on a system or systems. This is valuable for an attacker as it provides detailed information on potential attack vectors into a system. Understanding what applications are running on the system gives an attacker vital information before performing the actual penetration test.

The following sections detail the open ports discovered on the various systems discovered in the information gathering phase. In some cases, some ports may not be listed.
