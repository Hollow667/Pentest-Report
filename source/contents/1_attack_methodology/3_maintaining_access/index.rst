Maintaining Access - INCOMPLETE
===============================
Maintaining access to a system is important to attackers. Ensuring that they can get back into a system after it has been exploited is invaluable. Many exploits may only be exploitable once, preventing further attempts to gain access to the system. The maintaining access phase of the penetration test focuses on ensuring that once the pentester has access to the system, they can keep that access in the future.
